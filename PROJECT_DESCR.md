## Document Version: 1.0
## Date: May 13, 2025
## Project Title: Nour al-Ma'rifa (المعرفة نور) - "Light of Knowledge"

## 1. Introduction & Problem Statement

### 1.1. The Challenge
Foundational illiteracy in Egypt significantly limits opportunities for employment, access to essential information (health, financial services), and full societal participation. This hinders progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). Existing literacy programs often struggle with accessibility, engagement, and personalization, especially for adults who may find traditional settings or complex technology intimidating. Overlapping digital illiteracy creates an additional barrier to online learning resources.

### 1.2. Our Vision
"Nour al-Ma'rifa" aims to address this by offering an innovative, voice-centric, and gamified learning experience for illiterate and semi-literate Egyptian adults. By using intuitive design, localized AI tools, and audio interaction, we want to create an accessible, effective, and empowering way to learn basic Arabic literacy (letters and numbers). Our goal is to make the first steps into literacy and digital interaction as easy and encouraging as possible.

## 2. Proposed Solution: The "Nour al-Ma'rifa" PWA

### 2.1. Core Concept
We propose developing "Nour al-Ma'rifa" as a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Next.js (App Router). The main interaction method will be voice-based, using the EGTTS V0.1 model for Egyptian Arabic text-to-speech and the Google Gemini API for dynamic content and speech-to-text analysis.

### 2.2. Key Technological Pillars
- **Voice-First Interaction**: The app will use clear audio prompts in Egyptian Arabic (via EGTTS) for navigation, lessons, instructions, and feedback, minimizing the need for text. User input for exercises will also be primarily voice-based.
- **AI-Powered Personalization & Content**: The Gemini API will be used to:
    - Generate culturally relevant and simple example words/phrases for letters/numbers, tailored to Egypt.
    - Process user voice input (via Speech-to-Text) for pronunciation feedback.
    - (Future Scope) Potentially analyze user handwriting images.
- **Accessible & Intuitive UI/UX**: The interface will prioritize:
    - Large, clear icons and visual cues.
    - High contrast colors.
    - Minimal on-screen text (only letters/numbers being taught).
    - Large tap targets for users unfamiliar with touch interfaces.
    - Simple, linear navigation guided by voice prompts.
- **Gamification**: Basic game mechanics (points, badges, progress tracking) to boost motivation.
- **PWA Capabilities (MVP Focus)**: Basic manifest file and service worker for installability and caching static assets.
- **Data Persistence**: User progress, achievements, and profile info stored in a PostgreSQL database, possibly using Drizzle ORM.

## 3. Target Audience

### 3.1. Primary Users
- Illiterate or semi-literate adults in Egypt.
- **Motivation**: Want foundational literacy (Arabic alphabet, numbers) for personal growth, daily life improvement (reading signs, basic math), or potential jobs.
- **Technological Profile**: Likely use affordable smartphones. May have limited digital experience beyond basic communication (calls, WhatsApp). Might need initial help from a literate person to install/access.
- **Learning Needs**: Need a very simple, patient, and encouraging environment. Benefit greatly from audio-visual learning and repetition. May struggle with abstract ideas and need concrete examples.

## 4. Key Features (Hackathon MVP Scope)
Specific features for the 3-day hackathon:

### 4.1. Voice-First Interface & Navigation
- All instructions, prompts, feedback, and lessons delivered via EGTTS in Egyptian Arabic.
- Navigation mainly by tapping large icons (e.g., "Next Lesson," "Repeat Sound"). Voice confirms actions.
- Minimal text, focusing only on letters/numbers being taught and essential icons.

### 4.2. Simplified User Registration & Authentication
- **PIN-Based Authentication System**:
  - **Dual Registration Methods**:
    - **Text-Based**: A user (or helper) enters the user's name and creates a 4-digit PIN. System generates a unique numeric ID for future login.
    - **Voice-Based**: User speaks their name (recorded via microphone), then creates a 4-digit PIN. System generates a unique numeric ID for future login.
  - **Dual Login Methods**:
    - **Text-Based**: User enters their unique numeric ID and 4-digit PIN using a large keypad.
    - **Voice-Based**: User speaks their unique numeric ID, then enters their 4-digit PIN.
  - **User ID System**: Each user receives a unique numeric ID during registration (auto-incremented sequence). This ID is prominently displayed for the user to remember.
  - **PIN Security**: Simple 4-digit PIN is easy to remember but provides basic security.
  - **Rationale**: Supports both literate and illiterate users with appropriate authentication methods.
- **Persistent Login**: Use browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) to keep the user logged in on their device.

### 4.3. Core Learning Modules (MVP Content)
- **Arabic Letters Module**:
    - Focus: Introduce 3-5 distinct letters (e.g., أ, ب, ت, م, ن).
    - Content per Letter:
        - Large, clear visual display of the letter.
        - Audio pronunciation of the letter's name and sound (EGTTS).
        - 1-2 simple, culturally relevant example words starting with the letter (Gemini-generated, simple, EGTTS audio, with icon/image).
- **Numbers Module**:
    - Focus: Introduce numerals 0-5.
    - Content per Number:
        - Visual display of the numeral.
        - Audio pronunciation of the number's name (EGTTS).
        - Simple counting illustration (e.g., show '3' and three objects, EGTTS voice: "This is three. One, two, three apples.").

### 4.4. Interactive Exercises (Integrated within Modules)
- **Pronunciation Practice**:
    - Trigger: Microphone icon appears after letter/number intro.
    - Process: EGTTS prompts ("Say the sound 'Ba'"). User taps mic, browser captures audio. Audio sent to backend endpoint -> Gemini API (Speech-to-Text). Basic analysis (exact/close match).
    - Feedback: Encouraging EGTTS feedback ("Excellent!", "Good try, listen again: 'Ba'").
- **Identification Tasks**:
    - Trigger: Simple quiz after learning a few items.
    - Process: UI shows 2-3 learned letters/numbers. EGTTS prompts ("Touch the letter 'Ta'"). User taps choice.
    - Feedback: Visual (green check/red X) and audio (EGTTS: "Correct!").

### 4.5. Basic Gamification Elements
- **Points System**: Award points (+10) for completing lesson parts (learning a letter, passing practice). Stored in DB.
- **Visual Progress Indicator**: Simple bar/control showing progress in the current module ("Letters Learned: 2 out of 5"). EGTTS feedback ("You finished the lesson for 'Alef'!").
- **Badges (Simple)**: Award one basic badge (icon) for completing the Letters or Numbers module (MVP scope). Stored in DB.

### 4.6. Core Technology Integrations
- **EGTTS V0.1**: Integrated via API endpoint (local or separate) for all Egyptian Arabic speech.
- **Gemini API**: Accessed via backend calls for:
    - Generating example words (Text generation).
    - Processing user audio for pronunciation (Speech-to-Text).

- **Lesson Introduction (Visual & Auditory)**:
    - UI: Displays "ب" large, highlights it.
    - EGTTS: "ده حرف الباء. اسمه باء، وصوته بَ." (This is the letter Ba. Its name is Ba, and its sound is 'Ba'.)
    - Visual Animation: Letter "ب" pulses.
- **Example Word Generation & Presentation**:
    - Backend: Prompts Gemini: "Provide 1 simple, common Egyptian Arabic word starting with 'ب' (Ba), suitable for an illiterate adult learner. Give the word and a short descriptive phrase. Format: 'Word: Description.' Use only Egyptian Arabic."
    - Gemini Response (Example): "بطة: البطة بتعوم في المية." (Batta: The duck swims in the water.)
    - UI: Displays duck icon/image.
    - EGTTS: "باء، زي كلمة بطة. البطة بتعوم في المية." (Ba, like the word Batta. The duck swims in the water.)
- **Pronunciation Practice (Interactive)**:
    - UI: Microphone icon appears.
    - EGTTS: "قول معايا: بَ. دوس على الميكروفون واتكلم." (Say with me: 'Ba'. Tap the microphone and speak.)
    - User: Taps mic, says "ba". Audio captured.
    - Backend: Sends audio to Gemini STT. Gemini returns text ("با", "به", etc.).
    - Backend Logic: Compares transcription to target ("بَ" or close).
    - EGTTS (Feedback):
        - (Success): "هايل! كده صح!" (Great! That's right!) Award points (+10).
        - (Needs Improvement): "قريب! اسمع تاني: بَ. حاول مرة كمان." (Close! Listen again: 'Ba'. Try one more time.)
- **Simple Identification (Mini-Quiz after learning أ, ب, ت)**:
    - UI: Shows three boxes with أ, ب, ت.
    - EGTTS: "فين حرف الباء؟ دوس عليه." (Where is the letter Ba? Press it.)
    - User: Taps the box with "ب".
    - UI: Highlights "ب" in green.
    - EGTTS: "برافو عليك! ده حرف الباء." (Well done! This is the letter Ba.) Award points (+10).
- **Progress Update**:
    - UI: Progress bar updates.
    - EGTTS: "أنت خلصت حرف الباء. نكمل؟" (You finished the letter Ba. Shall we continue?)

## 9. Addressing Key Challenges & Mitigation (Hackathon Scope)
- **Challenge: PWA Complexity (Offline, Service Workers).**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Focus on basic installability (manifest) and caching static assets. Defer complex offline data sync.
- **Challenge: Camera Integration for Handwriting.**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Defer entirely. Too complex for the short scope.
- **Challenge: User Registration for Illiterate Users (Usability vs. Security).**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Dual-path authentication system with PIN-based security. Text-based method for literate users, voice-based for illiterate users. Each user gets a unique numeric ID for easy reference and login. Accept lower security for this context (4-digit PIN). Implement persistent login to minimize authentication frequency.
- **Challenge: Scope of Learning Content.**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Strictly limit letters (3-5) and numbers (0-5) for a demonstrable end-to-end flow. Quality over quantity.
- **Challenge: EGTTS & Gemini API Reliability/Latency.**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Basic error handling (try-catch), user feedback on failure, loading indicators. Ensure stable internet for demo, potentially have static fallbacks. Optimize backend speed.
- **Challenge: Accurate Pronunciation Analysis.**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Rely on Gemini STT. Simple analysis: check for exact/close matches to target sound/name. Focus on positive feedback.
- **Challenge: Speech-to-Text Recognition for User IDs.**
    - Mitigation (MVP): Implement simple numeric recognition for spoken IDs. Use client-side speech recognition with fallback UI if recognition fails. Provide visual confirmation of recognized numbers.

## 10. Design Principles
- Voice-First: Audio is the main way to interact.
- Simplicity: Minimalist UI, clear visuals, easy navigation.
