## Implementation Notes

### Database Connection
- Using Neon PostgreSQL with connection string in .env
- Drizzle ORM set up for type-safe database queries

### Database Schema
- Created tables for users, learning content, progress tracking, badges, and exercises
- Used PostgreSQL-specific features like enums and JSON columns for flexible data storage
- Set up foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Added migration scripts to initialize and update the database

### Authentication System
- Replaced image-based authentication with PIN-based system using 4-digit numeric codes
- Implemented dual authentication flows:
  - Text-based: Users type their ID number and PIN
  - Voice-based: Users speak their ID number and PIN
- Each user receives a unique numeric ID during registration for future login
- Created registration and login flows for both literacy capabilities
- Added name and user ID recording via microphone with speech-to-text using Gemini API
- Used Zustand with persist middleware for client-side session management
- Maintained server-side middleware for route protection
- Added voice-based PIN input for voice authentication flow
- Added confirmation steps with audio feedback for name and user ID

### User Interface
- Implemented full Arabic UI across the application
- Added RTL (right-to-left) text alignment and layout
- Implemented two-click button interaction with audio feedback
- Created audio feedback system for all interactive elements
- Added audio instructions and guidance for all major user flows
- Added clear visual indicators for button state and selection
- Enhanced buttons to be disabled during audio playback for better UX
- Created new UI components for PIN input with visual feedback
- Added back navigation buttons throughout the application
- Replaced text-based show/hide PIN controls with intuitive eye icons
- Enhanced recording interface with playback and confirmation options

### Speech to Text Implementation
- Created API route for speech-to-text processing using Gemini API
- Implemented specialized processing for different input types (name, userID, PIN)
- Added proper error handling and validation for speech recognition
- Implemented audio recording, processing, and feedback loop
- Added loading indicators during speech processing
- Implemented error feedback for failed speech recognition
- Added audio playback of recorded speech for verification
- Created seamless integration between recording and speech processing

### Audio System
- Implemented a sound system that plays audio on first click and performs action on second click
- Created mechanisms to handle audio queuing and cleanup
- Audio indicators play within a 30-second window for user action
- Audio system provides clear Egyptian Arabic instructions for all interactions
- Documented all needed audio files in Audio_Translations.json
- Buttons automatically disable while audio is playing
- Added confirmation audio feedback for user inputs

### UI/UX Design Principles
- Voice-first interaction
- High contrast colors for accessibility
- Large, clear visual elements
- Minimal text, maximum audio guidance
- Right-to-left layout for Arabic language
- Intuitive back navigation
- Clear feedback and confirmation options

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize audio file loading and playback
- Ensure responsive design for various devices
- Plan for offline capabilities through service worker

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

- Need to generate actual audio files listed in Audio_Translations.json
- Need to implement database migrations for schema changes
